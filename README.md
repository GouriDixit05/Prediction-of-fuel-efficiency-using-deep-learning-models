# Prediction-of-fuel-efficiency-using-deep-learning-models
This project deals with the prediction of fuel efficiency of vehicles from late 1970s to early 1980s. The dataset used in this project is taken from the UCI datasets. Instead of using Machine Learning libraries, this project uses single layer and multilayer perceptron models to predict the efficiency.
